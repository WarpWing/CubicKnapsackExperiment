# CubicKnapsackExperiment
Alternative theoretical methods to solving Cubic Knapsack Paradigms. Inspired by William Cheng's honor presentation.

>I'm not an expert at combinatorial optimization and these approaches are grounded in Computer Science Theory (Genetic Programming, Reinforcement Learning, etc).
>My mathematical skills are suboptimal for me to approach this from a Mathematical or Operations Theory perspective. This is just me applying my Leetcode skills and some preliminary theory.
