# CubicKnapsackExperiment
Alternative theoretical methods to solving the Cubic Knapsack Paradigm. Inspired by William Cheng's departmental honors presentation.

>[!NOTE]
>I'm not an expert at combinatorial optimization or metaheuristic applications and these approaches are grounded in Computer Science Theory (Genetic Programming, Quantum Approximation, etc).
>My mathematical skills are suboptimal for me to approach this from an Operations Theory perspective. This is just me applying my Leetcode skills and some preliminary theory. In addition, I plan to convert all of these approaches to Jupyter Notebooks eventually, I would first like to get the core scripts working.

>For the sake of academic integrity, this repository will not be shared with William until he completes the majority of his algorithm.
